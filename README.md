MTCountrySelectorModal
==========================

`MTCountrySelectorModal` is a view controller that allow users to choose
a country from a list.  The available countries are taken from the
[ISO 3166-1 standard][iso3166], whose [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2][iso31662] two-letter
country codes are used by the API to represent countries.

[iso3166]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166
[iso31662]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

It includes International Phone Number prefix for each country.

Features
--------

This library provides the following features:

  * A country can be selected from a list in a table view.
  * The list can be searched using a search bar. [TODO]
  * All the countries assigned a [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2][iso31662] two-letter code
    are available.
  * The list of countries presented by the controller can be filtered.
  * The following localisations are available:
    - English (en).
    - Italian (it).
    - Spanish (es).

Prerequisites
-------------

This library has been built with XCode 6 using iOS 8 as a build target.
This library requires iOS >= 8

This library requires [ARC][arc] (_Automatic Reference Counting_) and
compilation will fail if ARC support is not available.

Usage
-----

The `EMCCountryPickerController` must be presented modally by the presenting
view controller.  The `EMCCountryPickerController` won't dismiss itself when a
country is chosen.  Instead, `EMCCountryPickerController` instance will rely on
a delegate conforming to the `EMCCountryDelegate` protocol to receive the
country selection event and to dismiss it.  The delegate can be set either in
Interface Builder using the `countryDelegate` outlet or programmatically using
the `countryDelegate` property.  When using a storyboard, since an outlet
cannot be connected to a controller in another controller, the controller setup
is usually performed in `prepareForSegue:sender:`:

```
- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
{
    if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@"openCountryPicker"])
    {
        EMCCountryPickerController *countryPicker = segue.destinationViewController;
        countryPicker.countryDelegate = self;
    }
}
```

The `EMCCountryDelegate` protocol defines one selector which is invoked when a
country has been selected:

```
- (void)countryController:(id)sender didSelectCountry:(EMCCountry *)chosenCountry;
```

The presenting view controller usually conforms to this protocol, receives the
notification and dismisses the `EMCCountryPickerController` instance:

```
- (void)countryController:(id)sender didSelectCountry:(EMCCountry *)chosenCountry;
{
    // Do something with chosenCountry
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}
```

Searching Countries
-------------------

The view provides a search bar that can be used to filter countries _by name_,
as shown in the following screenshot.

![Main view](/Screenshots/main-view-search.png "Main View - Search")

Selecting the Set of Countries to Be Displayed
----------------------------------------------

Sometimes users need to restrict the set of countries to choose from and that
can be accomplished using the property

```
@property (copy) NSSet *availableCountryCodes;
```

Users can pass the set of [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2][iso31662] country codes of the
countries to be shown by this controller.  If a country code is not valid the
controller fails throwing an exception.

The following code fragment restricts the set of displayed countries to France,
Italy, Spain and United States, as shown in the following screenshot.

```
countryPicker.availableCountryCodes = [NSSet setWithObjects:@"IT", @"ES", @"US", @"FR", nil];
```

Showing and Hiding Flags
------------------------

Flags are shown by default and can be disabled using the property
`BOOL showFlags`.

![Main view](/Screenshots/main-view.png "Main View")

Flag Size
---------

Flag size can be customised using the `flagSize` property:

    countryPicker.flagSize = 20;

The table view cell row height will be adjusted accordingly.

![Main view](/Screenshots/main-view-big-flags.png "Main View - Big Flags (Resized to Fit in 80x80)")

Flag Borders
------------

By default a grey .5 border is drawn around a flag in order to improve its
visual appearance over the default white background.  The border can be
configured using the following properties:

  * `BOOL drawFlagBorder`: enables the flag border. Defaults to `YES`.
  * `UIColor *flagBorderColor`: sets the border color. Defaults to
    `[UIColor grayColor]`.
  * `CGFloat flagBorderWidth`: sets the border width. Defaults to `0.5f`.

Localised Country Names
-----------------------

The `EMCCountryPickerController` library ships with localised country names in:

  * English (en).
  * Italian (it).
  * Spanish (es).

Support for additional languages can be easily added by updating the
`countries.plist` file.

The current implementation selects the locale using the following algorithm:

  * If the `countryNameDisplayLocale` property of the view controller instance
    is set and not null, then a country name in the specified locale will be
    requested.
  * If a translation in the `countryNameDisplayLocale` locale is not available
    or it is null, then a translation in the first preferred locale will be
    requested, where the preferred locale is obtained using
    `[[NSLocale preferredLanguages] objectAtIndex:0]`.
  * If a translation in the preferred locale is not available, use English.

Demo Code
---------

A demo project named `EMCCountryPickerControllerDemo` using a storyboard and
highlighting the library major features is shipped with the library code.

Installation with CocoaPods
---------------------------

`EMCCountryPickerController` is available through [CocoaPods][cocoapods] and a
dependency to it can be added to your Podfile:

    pod 'EMCCountryPickerController' ~> '1.0'

Build the Software
------------------

The recommended way to get the sources of `EMCCountryPickerController` in order
to build it on your system is getting a [release tarball][release].
